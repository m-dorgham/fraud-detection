# fraud-detection
This is a notebook for exploring and comparing different methods for anomaly detection. I explore at least one method in each learning paradigm, namely, supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. In supervised learning I test a simple linear classifier (**logistic regression**) with the traditional technique of downsampling to handle data imbalance. In unsupervised learning, I test **autoencoders**, and **deep one-class classification**. In semi-supervised learning, I test a recent method called **Deep Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection** (Deep SAD) which is an extension of deep one-class classification. 

The dataset is downloaded from kaggle.com. [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) is the link to the original dataset on kaggle.

**Sometimes GitHub fails to load the notebooks. If this happens, you can have a look at my notebook on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mdorgham/fraud-detection-comparing-4-methods).**
